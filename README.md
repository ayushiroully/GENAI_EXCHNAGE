# 🌐 Google GenAI Exchange   
*By Ayushi Roully· #GenAIExchange*

This repository is part of the **#GenAIExchange program by Google Cloud**. It showcases hands-on labs using the **Gemini and Imagen APIs**, building real-world generative AI applications with multimodal capabilities — including image generation, prompt engineering, document QA, video analysis, and app development with Streamlit.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

✅ Generates images using **Imagen**  
✅ Analyzes those images with **Gemini Flash**  
✅ Builds real-world apps using **Streamlit + Gemini**  
✅ Interacts with **videos, PDFs, and visual documents**  
✅ Uses **function calling**, **RAG**, and **text streaming** with Gemini  
✅ Implements prompt design best practices for production-ready GenAI apps
