# GENAI_EXCHNAGE

This project is part of the [#GenAIExchange](https://cloud.google.com/training/generative-ai-exchange) program by Google Cloud. It demonstrates how to generate images from text using **Imagen**, and then analyze those images using **Gemini Flash** to generate a personalized message.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

- âœ… **Generates an image** of a custom bouquet using the `imagen-3.0-generate-002` model.
- âœ… **Analyzes the image** using `gemini-2.0-flash-001` and generates a **birthday wish** based on it.
- âœ… Uses **multimodal capabilities** (image + text) to simulate a real-world AI app flow.
- âœ… Supports **streaming output** from Gemini for a smoother experience.
