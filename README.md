#  Google GenAI Exchange Program
*By Ayushi Roully· #GenAIExchange*

This repository is part of the **#GenAIExchange program by Google Cloud**. It showcases hands-on labs using the **Gemini and Imagen APIs**, building real-world generative AI applications with multimodal capabilities — including image generation, prompt engineering, document QA, video analysis, and app development with Streamlit.

---

##  What This Project Does

Generates images using **Imagen**  
Analyzes those images with **Gemini Flash**  
Builds real-world apps using **Streamlit + Gemini**  
Interacts with **videos, PDFs, and visual documents**  
Uses **function calling**, **RAG**, and **text streaming** with Gemini  
Implements prompt design best practices for production-ready GenAI apps

### 4. **Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG**  
[Challenge Lab](https://github.com/ayushiroully/GENAI_EXCHNAGE/blob/main/Inspect%20Rich%20Documents%20with%20Gemini%20Multimodality%20and%20Multimodal%20RAG/Challenge%20Lab.md)  
- Used Gemini to analyze **PDFs, images, and videos**
- Implemented **multimodal RAG** for document question answering
- Extracted structured insights using embeddings and helper functions.

---

### 5.  **Explore Generative AI with the Gemini API in Vertex AI**  
[Challenge Lab](https://github.com/ayushiroully/GENAI_EXCHNAGE/blob/main/Explore%20Generative%20AI%20with%20the%20Gemini%20API%20in%20Vertex%20AI/Challenge%20Lab.md)  
- Interacted with Gemini via `curl` and Python SDK
- Implemented **function calling** to simulate weather lookup
- Used Gemini Flash to analyze and describe video content
